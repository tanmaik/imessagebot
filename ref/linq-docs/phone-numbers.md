# Phone Numbers

Phone Numbers represent the messaging-enabled phone numbers in your organization, supporting iMessage, RCS, and SMS.

Each phone number is associated with a user and can be used to send and receive messages. Messages are automatically sent using the best available protocol (iMessage → RCS → SMS). Phone numbers can have forwarding numbers configured.
